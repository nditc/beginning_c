    // `endl` is a new line
    cout << "World" << endl;

    // u can chain multiple data together

    // Basically "Hello\tTechies!\n"

    // `cout` is a function residing in that magic `iostream.h` file
    // on windows u may find it under `C:/MingW/includes/`
    // on linux is is in `/usr/includes`

    // `cout` represents what we call `standard output`.
    // we will go on depth later.
    // for now it's our way to output data
